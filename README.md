# EntraID automation repo! #

## by this repository I will guiding my way through entraID and do following actions

1 - Remove users from tenant block more than X numbers of days
2 - Fork the repository and do something with Microsoft TODO and Jira using API OR autogui

The EntraID tenant Im using is a dev license with limited resources but just enought for get the job done.

Let's see if I can get this as far as I planned!
