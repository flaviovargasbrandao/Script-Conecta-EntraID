# EntraID Automation Repo! #

## In this repository, I’ll be documenting my journey with EntraID while implementing the following tasks: #

Fork the repository and integrate it with Microsoft To Do and Jira using either their APIs or AutoGUI.

The EntraID tenant I’m using is a developer license with limited resources — but just enough to get the job done.

Let’s see how far I can take this!
