# This script connects to EntraID (Azure Active Directory) using the MSAL library
# and retrieves an access token to make API calls to Microsoft Graph.

# uses the following libraries:
# - os: to access environment variables
# - dotenv: to load environment variables from a .env file
# - requests: to make HTTP requests to the Microsoft Graph API
# - msal: to handle authentication with Microsoft EntraID
